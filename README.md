## Project Overview
A team project that developed an arcade system designed to streamline operations and provide a user-friendly experience for both customers and employees.

## Features
Menu-driven Interface: Users can add, update, and delete memberships, games, and prizes.  
Gameplay: Playing games requires tokens, and each game session is recorded in the database.  
Leaderboards: High scores are displayed on game consoles, allowing players to compete and improve their scores.  
Rewards: Players earn reward tickets from games, redeemable at the prize counter.  
Database Management: All information, including memberships, game sessions, transactions, and rewards, 
is meticulously stored and managed in the database.

## Setup
Utilize JDBC to connect with Oracle SQL database within my school system.  
Since this Oracle SQL database is part of my school system, the JDBC connection string is:  
"jdbc:oracle:thin:@aloe.cs.arizona.edu:1521:oracle"  
In order to run the program, the user must include their Oracle username and Oracle password.
